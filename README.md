# marilega-autosplitter

My first attempt at an autosplitter. It's very simple, but MarisaLand Legacy isn't an especially complex game, so it should serve its function well.

Only works with v1.30, so heads up if you downloaded the game from Moriya Shrine. 



Features:

-Customize autosplits to be done when you touch the end-of-level balloon or when the level transitions. I would recommend level transition splits as they are guaranteed to work 100% of the time and are frame perfect. Balloon splits were not as cut-and-dry to figure out, and so be aware they will malfunction every once in a while.

-Automatically resets timer on stage select

-Works with both Marisa and Alice




Bugs/Issues:

-On most stages, if using balloon splits, the timer going under 100 triggers a split. This is especially apparent in Hard Mode, so I'd recommend turning it off for that.

-Getting 8 heads tall triggers a split. I can't find mushroom hex values for the life of me, so if anyone wants to give it a go, be my guest.

-On rare occasions, 4-2 may split randomly in the middle of the stage. This is only a problem if you're running Warpless.

-If you beat the game while having 6 heads tall, the final split will be off by a few frames.

-1-1 and 5-1 are two other stages that are kinda finicky with their splits, but it's so rare I wouldn't consider them major issues yet.

-Hard Mode's ending mushroom will most likely not split.


Please create a pull request or message me if you figure out how to fix any of these issues.
