# marilega-autosplitter

Was curious if I could put my limited programming experience to use, and here it is: my first attempt at an autosplitter. It's very simple, but MarisaLand Legacy isn't an especially complex game, so it should serve its function well. Unless I did something horribly wrong, in which case, let me know.
Most likely only works with v1.30, so heads up if you downloaded the game from Moriya Shrine.


Features:

-Automatically resets timer on stage select

-Final mushroom split is frame perfect

-Should work with both Marisa and Alice
