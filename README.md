# marilega-autosplitter

Was curious if I could put my limited programming experience to use, and here it is: my first attempt at an autosplitter. It's very simple, but MarisaLand Legacy isn't an especially complex game, so it should serve its function well. Unless I did something horribly wrong, in which case, let me know.
