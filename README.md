# marilega-autosplitter

My first attempt at an autosplitter. It's very simple, but MarisaLand Legacy isn't an especially complex game, so it should serve its function well.

Only works with v1.30, so heads up if you downloaded the game from Moriya Shrine. 

Also functions with Hard Mode as well...but since I haven't gotten to its final screen I can't confirm the ending will split correctly. Please let me know or suggest changes if you're interested in this functionality.


Features:

-Customize autosplits to be done when you touch the end-of-level balloon or when the level transitions. I would recommend level transition splits as they are guaranteed to work 100% of the time and are frame perfect. Balloon splits were not as cut-and-dry to figure out, and so be aware they will malfunction every once in a while.

-Automatically resets timer on stage select

-Works with both Marisa and Alice




Bugs/Issues (BALLOON SPLITS ONLY):

-On rare occasions, 4-2 may split randomly in the middle of the stage. This is only a problem if you're running Warpless.

-If you beat the game while having 6 heads tall, the final split will be off by a few frames.

-1-1 and 5-1 are two other stages that are kinda finicky with their splits, but it's so rare I wouldn't consider them major issues yet.


Report any other weird occurences and I will look into it.
