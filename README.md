# marilega-autosplitter

My first attempt at an autosplitter. It's very simple, but MarisaLand Legacy isn't an especially complex game, so it should serve its function well - unless I did something horribly wrong, in which case, let me know.

Only works with v1.30, so heads up if you downloaded the game from Moriya Shrine. 

Should work flawlessly if you're running warpless or 100%, but there might be certain hidden rooms that unintentionally trip a split trigger. I tested most of them, but if there's one I missed, let me know and I'll patch it as soon as possible.

Also functions with Hard Mode as well...but since I haven't gotten to its final screen I can't confirm the ending will split correctly. Please let me know or suggest changes if you're interested in this functionality.


Features:

-Customize autosplits to be done when you touch the end-of-level balloon or when the level transitions

-Automatically resets timer on stage select

-Final mushroom split is frame perfect

-Works with both Marisa and Alice


Bugs:

3-4 sometimes splits incorrectly

4-2 sometimes splits incorrectly

5-1 sometimes splits incorrectly
